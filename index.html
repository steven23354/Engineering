                <h3>What careers are there in mechanical engineering?</h3>
                <p>Society depends on mechanical engineering. The need for this expertise is great in so many fields, and as such, there is no real limit for the freshly minted mechanical engineer. Jobs are always in demand, particularly in the automotive,
                     aerospace, electronics, biotechnology, and energy industries.
                    <br>Mechanical engineers play vital roles in the aerospace industry, 
                    contributing to various aspects of aircraft and spacecraft design, development, and maintenance.

                <h3>What do mechanical engineers do?</h3>
                <p>Mechanical engineering combines creativity, knowledge and analytical tools to complete the difficult task of shaping an idea into reality.

                    This transformation happens at the personal scale,
                     affecting human lives on a level we can reach out and touch like robotic prostheses. 
                     It happens on the local scale, affecting people in community-level spaces, like with agile interconnected microgrids. And it happens on bigger scales, like with advanced power systems, 
                    through engineering that operates nationwide or across the globe.</p>

                <h3>What skills do mechanical engineers need?</h3>
                <p>The essence of engineering is problem solving.
                     With this at its core, mechanical engineering also requires applied creativity—a hands on understanding of the work involved—along with strong interpersonal skills like networking,
                      leadership, and conflict management. Creating a product is only part of the equation;
                     knowing how to work with people, ideas, data, and economics fully makes a mechanical engineer.</p>
